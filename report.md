# **Tech Stack**

MERN stack and Cloudinary storage are the combination of technologies used to build our entry for Hello tractor ecommerce hackathon. We used a combination of MongoDB, Express JS, React JS, and Node JS stacked together to handle the entire ecommerce process form the database and server to the client-side interface. Cloudinary stores our listings' images safe and secure.

1. MongoDB (M) ðŸ¡ª A NoSQL database for storing the store's data including users and listings.

2. Express.js (E) ðŸ¡ª Framework for Node.js, which we used to create server-side logic and APIs.

3. React.js (R) ðŸ¡ª Component based JavaScript library for the store's client-side interfaces.

4. Node.js (N) ðŸ¡ª JavaScript runtime environment for running Express.js on the server side.

# **Key Features**

## **Store Front**

1. A nicely polished modern and functional front store to view, search, filter listings based on make, model and prices.

2. A simple navigation hierarchy for buyers to view detail of listings.

3. Buyers can see seller's details on demand and message them directly from the store front's message interface.

## **User Login and Registration**

1. Users can register and login as buyers or sellers either through their Emails or their Google profile.

2. Secure Email verification process.

## **Roles and Portals**

### **Admin**

1. Admin has an Admin Portal which they can access upon login to a protected route.

2. Admin can do the following through the portal interface

    1. Approve, suspend or reject pending listings and sellers. If approved, new listings will be available to buyers on the store front and new sellers will be able to create new listings pending approval of admin.

    2. Send or broadcast messages from the portal.

    3. View major performance metrics on the portal's dashboard page. These include number of users, listings, pending listings and so on.

    4. Create new sellers for fast seller onboarding. Admin can also create new listings then quickly available on store front.

### **Seller**

1. Seller has a Seller Portal accessible through a protected route.

2. Through the Portal's interface, a seller can do the following.

    1. Create listings

    2. See status of listings created

    3. See messages received

## **Storage**

An interface where sellers and admins can upload multiple listings' images. Sellers get their image's URL ready to be stored on MongoDB database upon successful upload to Cloudinary's image storage cloud making for a smooth user experience.

## **Service center**

A single page containing service center information for spare parts and tractor operators.

## **Additional Features**

A footer section that contains major information found from the official hellotractor.com page. It contains information and links to major hello tractor services and products.

The UI/UX elements are reflect the color and font style picks suggested for us to use for the web application.

# **Challenges**

Upon joining this hackathon, we knew we would be in for a major week-long ride. And we did! We faced challenges including deciding which technology stack will suit our skillsets best, is scalable and will give us the best result in the short available week. But most of all, the biggest challenge was finding secure, fast and efficient ways for client-server side communication specially related to user roles and database data handling.

# **! Side Info**
We deployed the store on render for free. According to Render and our experiences, the server spins down with less activity. Meaning, it might take more time than needed to fetch data from the server. Render says, that could be upto 60 seconds. And so please be wary that there might be lags during listing fetches. 

# **Lessons Learned**

Here are few,

1. A really good ecommerce store starts from how the data is organized and modelled. Well worked through models can help the store scale without strong overloads on adapting data models and server-side logics.

2. Identifying security levels of data access is crucial in protecting the store's users and other sensitive information.

3. For functional and efficient web technology, a team shall have an interconnection of skillsets within. We've simply learned that we would have benefited from a bigger team size. For example, on graphics, and UI/UX design.

4. Such a tightly packed hackathon reveals the importance of focused work. And how if a team of engineers and creators work together day-in day-out, amazing products can come reveal themselves -- which even this entry submission for nexus reveals to us and hopefully to you!

Thank you and best wishes!
